/** \class
 * Once a vacuum region mesh has been generated, it needs to be recombined,
 * with the mesh of the original part to create the full mesh. This will results
 * in lots of duplicate nodes. We can store nodes in an rTree, and when we want
 * to add nodes we query the tree to see if an identical node exists. To decide
 * whether the node is a duplicate or not, a tolerance value is used. So if
 * nodes are within the euclidian distance described by "tolerance", the rTree
 * returns a "hit" to show that an identical node already exists.
 *
 * The functionality in this class is used to help identify a suitable
 * tolerance. A divide and conquer algorithm is used to identify the closest
 * pair of nodes in a mesh. Using this value, we can identify a suitable choice
 * of tolerance for the rTree. To learn more about the divide and conquer check
 * out this paper by Shamos and Bentley,
 * http://euro.ecom.cmu.edu/people/faculty/mshamos/1976ShamosBentley.pdf

  /** Method to find the closest distance between any pair of points in a 3D
   * mesh. Uses divide and conquer to perform the operation in O(nlog(n)) time
   * (almost). A quick explanation can be given here, although I'm probably not
   * the best person to give it. The problem space, which can be thought of as a
   * points cloud, is split in
   * 2. The splitting point might not be the geometric middle, but there are an
   * approximately equal number of points on both sides. This is done
   * recursively for each subspace until the base cases are reached. These base
   * cases occur when n(number of points) = 2 or 3, at which point the distance
   * of these points is compared. When you find you have to combine two space,
   * algorithmic voodoo takes place to do this in not much time. This probably
   * isn't the place to learn or understand this, so follow the link to the
   * paper I put which does a much better job than I ever could.
